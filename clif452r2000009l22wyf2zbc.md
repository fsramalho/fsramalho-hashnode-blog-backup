Hi everyone and welcome to what will be my tech-knowledge garden (at least, that's my goal with this blog). I have decided to embark on this new adventure of blogging to document and share my knowledge and experiences in the world of software development.

The posts might include ideas, TILs (Today I Learned), tips and tricks, or documentation of steps and procedures, among others, usually in the context of programming. Although, in most cases, they might cover contents that may already exist elsewhere, here I will share them from my perspective, with my opinion, using my own words, and always explicitly citing the sources. On the other hand, they can also encompass insights that I have personally developed and find valuable enough to share with others.

Just as software development is an iterative and ever-evolving process, so too is the craft of writing. I will challenge myself to overcome the inclination to endlessly refine and perfect my posts, instead prioritizing the act of getting them written and published, only then making tweaks if needed according to incoming feedback.

**Growing Beyond Code**

In addition to the *techy* context, with this blog, I also pretend to improve my (English) writing skills constituting an exercise to refine my grammar and syntax as well as find new ways to express my ideas.
